<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a timestamped backup of the current (or specified) directory.

.DESCRIPTION
    Copies all files (recursively) from the source directory into a new, 
    timestamped folder under the destination path. Optionally compresses the 
    backup into a ZIP file and logs errors.

.PARAMETER Destination
    The root folder where backups will be stored. Will be created if it doesn't exist.

.PARAMETER Source
    The directory to back up. Defaults to the current working directory.

.PARAMETER Compress
    Switch to compress the backup folder into a ZIP archive after the copy.

.PARAMETER LogFile
    Path to a file where errors will be written. Defaults to 'Backup-Directory.log' 
    in the destination folder.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Backup-Directory.ps1 -Destination 'D:\Backups' -Compress -Verbose

.NOTES
    Exit codes:
      0 = Success
      1 = Invalid parameters or failed to create destination
      2 = Error during copy/compress
